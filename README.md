## üìú Assignment Details

### üóÇÔ∏è Assignment 1: File System Operations (`a1/`)
This assignment focuses on interacting with a **custom binary file format** (`SF` - section file) and performing **file system operations**.

#### Implemented Features
- Listing directory contents with filtering options (**name suffix, permissions**).
- Parsing and validating SF files to extract metadata.
- Extracting a specific line from a section in an SF file (lines are stored in **reverse order**).
- Recursively searching for SF files that meet specific criteria.

#### Constraints
- Only **low-level system calls** (`open()`, `read()`, `write()`) were allowed.
- **No use of higher-level C functions** such as `fopen()`, `fgets()`, or `fprintf()`.

### üîÑ Assignment 2: Processes and Threads (`a2/`)
This assignment involves **process creation**, **thread management**, and **synchronization in Linux**.

#### Implemented Features
- Creating a specific hierarchy of processes.
- Implementing thread synchronization within a process.
- Enforcing execution order constraints between threads.
- Implementing a thread barrier to limit the number of concurrently running threads.
- Synchronizing threads across different processes.

#### Constraints
- Used **POSIX threads (`pthread`)** and **semaphores** for synchronization.
- Allowed interaction with the testing script **only** through the provided `info()` and `init()` functions.
- No file system interactions or certain system calls (e.g., `sleep()`, `nanosleep()`) were allowed.

### üîó Assignment 3: Inter-Process Communication (`a3/`)
This assignment involves **implementing inter-process communication** using **named pipes (FIFOs)** and **shared memory**.

#### Implemented Features
- Establishing communication via **named pipes** (`REQ_PIPE`, `RESP_PIPE`).
- Handling various requests, including:
  - Ping request ‚Üí Responding with `"PONG"`.
  - Shared memory creation and data writing.
  - File mapping using `mmap()`.
  - Reading from a file at offsets, from sections, or using a **logical memory space**.
  - Cleaning up resources properly upon receiving an **exit request**.

#### Constraints
- Used **memory-mapped files (`mmap()`)** instead of direct `read()` calls.
- Managed shared memory using **POSIX shared memory (`shm_open()`)**.
- Followed a strict **request-response protocol**.
